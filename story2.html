            M&M Lettuce Farm and Samgy Garden started with a simple dream — to create a place where nature, good food, and warm experiences come together. What began as a small plot of land dedicated to growing fresh lettuce eventually blossomed into a vibrant farm and restaurant where families, friends, and travelers can enjoy healthy meals straight from the garden.

            We believe in the beauty of hard work, patience, and love for nature. Every leaf of lettuce, every dish served, and every corner of our garden carries a story of dedication and passion. We wanted to build a place where guests not only eat but also feel connected to the land and the people behind it.

            Today, M&M Lettuce Farm and Samgy Garden stands as a peaceful escape from the busy city life — a spot where laughter is shared over hearty meals and where the freshness of the farm can be tasted in every bite. We continue to grow and serve with one goal in mind: to make every visit memorable and meaningful.
